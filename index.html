									<h2>Is Deleting Social Media Really the Key to Success?</h2>
								</header>
								<p>In recent years, social networking sites have been under scrutiny about the possible detrimental effects they could have on users.

In reality, there isn't a universal solution and it's not likely that deleting social media can deliver all of the promises made by this new fad. </p>
