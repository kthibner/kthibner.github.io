									<h2>Live up to Your Standards, Not Anybody Else's.

								</header>
								<p>As a college student, my focus has shifted. Instead of focusing on being my best, healthy self, I'm caught up in pushing myself further than my peers because I feel like I have to compete. We all do it, at least subconsciously, but if we want to minimize college stress, we have to stop.</p>

									<h2>Will Deleting Your Social Media Transform You Into Your Best Self?</h2>
								</header>
								<p>I quit social media when I was sixteen years old, because I thought I'd have higher self esteem and be more productive without it. It's been four years, and I'm about to re-download the apps, because I've learned that bettering yourself is so much deeper than deleting social media.</p>
