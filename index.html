									<h2>Live up to Your Standards, Not Anybody Else's.

								<p>As a college student, I am no stranger to stress. My peers are'nt either. We all deal with stress at some point in our collegiate lives, but why is stress so prominent on college campuses? Part of it is student workload, part is preparing for the future, part of it is feeling a lack of balance in our lives. But a lot of that is stuff we put on ourselves. We push ourselves further than we should to cmopete with our peers, who then push themselves further, which results in us adding more to compete with our peers' new levels, and the result is a viscious cycle of students putting too much on their plates. We have to break the cycle. Whether you're a prospective student, current student, or recent grad still recovering, this blog post is for you. It discusses the stress of a college campus, what you can do about it, but most importantly reassures you that you are not alone in the struggle.</p>

									<h2>Should You Delete Social Media to Become Your Best Self?</h2>
								</header>
								<p>I've heard things going around, and I'm sure you have, too. "Instagram influencer's are toxic; Twitter has 'Fake News'; Facebook sells your information." Don't forget: "They're always on their phones; They don't ever just live in the moment; They're too focused on likes." Blah, blah, blah. Sure, there has been some scrutiny over social media and its potential negative impacts, but is deleting all social media the solution? It's not that simple. I deleted my social media accounts years ago, and I can tell you that I am not my "best self" because of that choice. Read my blog to learn more about my experience and why bettering yourself is so much deeper than deleting social media.</p>
